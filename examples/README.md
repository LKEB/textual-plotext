# `textual-plotext` example

![The example code in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Textualize/textual-plotext/main/textual-plotext-example.png)

[This code](./textual_towers_weather.py) is provided as an example of how to
use the `PlotextPlot` widget provided by `textual-plotext`. As a bonus it
also shows an example of using Textual's [worker
API](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/) to create a [threaded
worker](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/#thread-workers) to pull
the data from the backend.
